The worms crawl in.
The worms crawl out.
The worms play penuchle
On your snout.

They bring all their friends
And their friends friends too,
And there's nothing much left
When they're through with you.



Vermes in reptant.
Vermes ex reptant.
Vermes pinochle in nares ludere.

Sunt adducam omne amicis / sunt eorum amicis / Suis venit
Et amicorum amicis etiam,
Et est nihil
Cum sunt per cum vobis.
